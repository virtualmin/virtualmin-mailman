---- Changes since 1.0 ----

List members can now be added and removed.
---- Changes since 3.2 ----
Improved Ubuntu support (mailman command location and output from admin scripts).
Added check for missing mailman program.
---- Changes since 3.3 ----
Changed API to allow creation of mailing lists without a domain.
---- Changes since 3.4 ----
When a mailing list is created in a virtual server with a website, it is configured so that the /mailman and /cgi-bin/mailman URLs actually work. This is done by running the mailman programs via Webmin, where they get executed as the correct user regardless of the virtual host suexec settings.
---- Changes since 3.6 ----
Added a Module Config option for the Webmin URL to use in the Apache config.
Redirects are now added to both the SSL and non-SSL Apache virtual hosts.
---- Changes since 3.8 ----
Fixed backups of mailing lists with no public or private archives.
